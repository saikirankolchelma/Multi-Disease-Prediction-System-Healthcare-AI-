🏥 Healthcare Disease Prediction System
📌 Project Overview
This project is an AI-powered healthcare disease prediction system designed to predict the likelihood of diseases such as COVID-19, heart attack, diabetes, etc. based on patient symptoms or uploaded medical reports.
The solution leverages Machine Learning & Deep Learning models and is deployed on Azure for real-time predictions.

The system has two modes of prediction:

Symptom-based – User inputs symptoms, and the model predicts the most likely disease.

Report-based – User uploads medical scans/reports (like X-rays, ECG, or blood test results), and the model analyzes them to provide a diagnosis.

🎯 Features
Multiple disease prediction support (COVID-19, Heart Attack, Diabetes, etc.)

Two input methods – symptom-based or report upload

Interactive UI with Flask web application

Real-time predictions with high accuracy

Deployed on Azure with cloud scalability

Secure patient data handling

    📊 Workflow
Data Collection

Public healthcare datasets (Kaggle, WHO, CDC)

Custom patient data (anonymized)

Medical report images

Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values

Encode categorical variables

Normalize/standardize features

Image preprocessing (resize, grayscale, noise removal)

Model Building

Symptom-based: Classification models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression)

Report-based: CNN-based deep learning models (ResNet, VGG16, EfficientNet)

Model Evaluation

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC

Cross-validation for robustness

Deployment
